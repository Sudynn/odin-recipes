    <h1>Summer Meat Slaw</h1>
    <img src="../images/Meat Slaw.jpg" alt="Meat Slaw" widht="310" height="310">
    <p>This summer meat slaw is the most exciting thing to happen to coleslaw in centuries. You can use leftover pulled pork—I used kalua pork—or any cooked meat, and it is unlike any slaw you've ever had. Your summer cookouts will never be the same.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head green cabbage</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sliced green onions, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 large carrot</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>4 cups pulled pork or other cooked, shredded meat</li>
        <li>1/4 cup avocado oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chile garlic sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Halve and core cabbage; cut each half into 2 pieces, and slice cabbage into 1/4-inch thick strips; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add green onions, bell pepper, and garlic to a large mixing bowl. With a vegetable peeler, peel thin strips of carrot over the top.</li>
        <li>Place a nonstick skillet over high heat and add pork. Cook until pork is very hot and a brown crust is forming on the meat, about 5 minutes. If meat is lean, 1 to 2 tablespoons of oil can be added to the pan as needed. Pour hot pork over veggies and mix with tongs to combine.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons oil to the same pan and place over high heat. Transfer in cabbage and salt. Cook, stirring, until cabbage softens and starts to brown in spots, but still retains a bit of crunch.</li>
        <li>Add cabbage, black pepper, Sriracha, and rice vinegar to the bowl; mix slaw thoroughly. Add cilantro, and mix thoroughly.  Taste for seasoning, and adjust salt and pepper, heat, and vinegar as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature, garnished with thinly sliced green onion. If making ahead, warm slaw before serving.</li>
    </ol>
